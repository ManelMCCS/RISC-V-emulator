# RISC-V-emulator
Project to learn RISC-V architecture and learn Rust programming language

# Project steps:

## Step 1: Familiarizing with the RISC-V architecture and instruction set

The first step in creating a RISC-V emulator is to familiarize with the architecture and instruction set. The detailed information about the architecture and instruction set in the RISC-V specification documents, which are available at https://riscv.org/.

## Step 2: Designing and implementing the emulator

Next, I will need to design and implement the emulator. This will likely involve creating a struct or class to represent the state of the emulator (e.g., the register file, memory, etc.), and implementing functions or methods that simulate the execution of RISC-V instructions. I may also want to implement features such as debugging support and a disassembler.

## Step 3: Testing the emulator

Once you have implemented the emulator, I will need to test it to ensure that it is working correctly. I can do this by running the emulator on a suite of test programs and comparing the output with the expected results.

## Step 4: Optimizing the emulator for performance (optional)

If I want to optimize the emulator for performance, there are many ways you can do this. Some options include using fast lookup tables or implementing just-in-time (JIT) compilation.
