# RISC-V-emulator
Project to learn RISC-V architecture and learn Rust programming language

# Project steps:

## Step 1 (in progress): Familiarizing with the RISC-V architecture and instruction set

The first step in creating a RISC-V emulator is to familiarize with the architecture and instruction set. The detailed information about the architecture and instruction set in the RISC-V specification documents, which are available at https://riscv.org/.
These documents provide a detailed specification of the architecture and instruction set, as well as information about the various RISC-V implementations and extensions.

* In addition to reading the specification documents, I may also want to consider the following resources:

* The RISC-V Instruction Set Manual (ISAv2.2): This manual provides a detailed description of the RISC-V instruction set, including the encoding and semantics of each instruction. It is available at https://riscv.org/specifications/.

* The RISC-V External Debug Support specification: This specification defines the architecture and implementation requirements for external debug support in RISC-V processors. It is available at https://riscv.org/specifications/.

* The RISC-V Privileged Architecture specification: This specification defines the architecture and implementation requirements for privileged mode in RISC-V processors. It is available at https://riscv.org/specifications/.

* The RISC-V Software Stack: This is a collection of software tools and libraries that are designed to work with RISC-V processors. It includes tools for assembling and disassembling RISC-V instructions, as well as libraries for implementing system-level functionality such as virtual memory and system calls. The RISC-V Software Stack is available at https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tools.

## Step 2: Designing and implementing the emulator

Next, I will need to design and implement the emulator. This will likely involve creating a struct or class to represent the state of the emulator (e.g., the register file, memory, etc.), and implementing functions or methods that simulate the execution of RISC-V instructions. I may also want to implement features such as debugging support and a disassembler.

## Step 3: Testing the emulator

Once you have implemented the emulator, I will need to test it to ensure that it is working correctly. I can do this by running the emulator on a suite of test programs and comparing the output with the expected results.

## Step 4: Optimizing the emulator for performance (optional)

If I want to optimize the emulator for performance, there are many ways you can do this. Some options include using fast lookup tables or implementing just-in-time (JIT) compilation.

# RISC-V components:

Register file: The register file is a set of registers that hold data values and intermediate results. RISC-V has 32 general-purpose registers (x0-x31), as well as several special-purpose registers such as the program counter (pc) and the stack pointer (sp).

Memory: The emulator will need to include some form of memory to store data and instructions. This can be represented using an array or a vector in Rust.

Instruction decoder: The instruction decoder is responsible for decoding and interpreting the instructions that are fetched from memory. It translates the instructions into the appropriate actions that need to be taken by the emulator.

Execution units: The execution units are responsible for executing the instructions that are decoded by the instruction decoder. This may involve manipulating the register file, accessing memory, or performing arithmetic or logical operations.

Interrupt handling: Some RISC-V implementations support interrupts, which allow external devices to interrupt the normal execution of the processor. The emulator will need to include support for handling interrupts, including setting and clearing interrupt flags and handling the interrupt service routine (ISR).

Debugging support: It is often useful to include debugging support in an emulator, such as the ability to single-step through the execution of instructions, set breakpoints, or inspect the register file and memory.
